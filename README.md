# Horiseon Social Solutions

## Description

    I began working on this challenge to test my knowledge, and to see if I was able to apply the principles of basic HTML stucture, semantics, and basic CSS styling. While ensuring to implement best practices and commenting for future developers that may be looking at the code.

    During the challenge I was able to identify and refine all the elements that were used in the structure of the HTML file to make it readable and accessible to future developers. Many div elements were replaced to their proper HTML elements to follow best practices. Alt attributes were added to existing images, elements follow logical structure, proper indentetion was implemented, and code falls in sequential order while keeping the original webpage as is.

    Overall, by implementing all of these simple changes I was able to fully understand and grasp the importance of following best practices when coding, and begin to understand the mind of a developer while building better lasting habits.

## Instillation
